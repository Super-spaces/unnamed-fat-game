Weight Descriptions 

Describe Stomach, Breasts, and Butt

Weight Level 1

You look upon yourself in the mirror, the clothing you wear draping across your form like the breezing curtains upon a window. Your thin form is very gaunt, with a concave stomach and the beginnings of sucken cheeks. Your breasts are mostly flat, and your butt shares the same fate. <br><br> If someone were to look upon you in public they would most likely assume you were having trouble getting food. 







Strength System 

1-100 increases by 5 for every successful workout, decreases by 5 after 3 days of no workout. 

1-10 = +1 
11-20 = +2... 

etc
